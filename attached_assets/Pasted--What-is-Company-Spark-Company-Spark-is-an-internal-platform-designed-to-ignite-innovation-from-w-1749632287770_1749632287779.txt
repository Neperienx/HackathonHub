🧠 What is Company Spark?
Company Spark is an internal platform designed to ignite innovation from within. Through recurring hackathon-style events, employees across departments can form teams, develop ideas, and create solutions that push the company forward.

It’s about unlocking creativity, encouraging collaboration, and making the most of our collective talent—across engineering, business, software, and operations.
